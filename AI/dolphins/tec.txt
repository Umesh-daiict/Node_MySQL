SQL quetion type

I have one DB that has multiple school data-related data about school students' exam test results. the student's ages are varied from age 10-18. and schools have bases in Europe db contains data related to multiple language base exams. give me a short SQL script to find how many students have a native language as English. we define the the student has native language if he/she has been given a minimum of 3 tests for the English language by the age of 12.

3. Additional Context

**Content and Contextual**
• Provide context-specific instructions to guide the model's responses. For example, instruct the model to explain if a question is unclear or not factually coherent. You can also request that the model include specific information.
• Specify the type of content you want the model to generate, such as informative, entertaining, or educational responses.


**Language Style***
• Instruct the model to use a certain language style, such as formal, informal, technical, or conversational.
• Specify any linguistic guidelines, such as avoiding jargon, using plain language, or adapting the response for a specific audience.



**Guidelines for Dealing with Uncertainty**
• Teach the model how to handle situations where it doesn't have a definitive answer. Instruct it to admit uncertainty or offer educated guesses rather than providing inaccurate information

**Bias and Sensitivity Engagement and Interaction**
• Instruct the model to correct any biased language or assumptions in the user's input.



**Length and Conciseness**
• Instruct the model to ask clarifying questions if the user's input is ambiguous or unclear.
• Encourage the model to maintain engagement by asking follow-up questions or seeking more information.


**Geographic and Location-Based**
• Limit the length of responses, ensuring that they are concise and to the point. Instruct the model to provide comprehensive explanations without unnecessary verbosity.
• Instruct the model to consider geographic or location-based context when generating responses. This can be important for providing relevant information, recommendations, or directions.


**Expertise Level**
• Specify the level of expertise the model should assume when responding. For instance, it can act as a beginner, intermediate, or expert in a particular field.

**Time Sensitivity**
• Instruct the model to provide responses that are relevant to the current time frame, such as recent news, events, or trends.
• Guide the model to avoid providing outdated information.

**Humor and Wit**
• Guide the model on when and how to use humor, wit, or clever wordplay in responses

**Formatting and Structure**
• Instruct the model on how to structure its responses, such as using bullet points for lists, headers for sections, or links for references.
