Flemigo tip

There is a rare occurence that you will see a different header, such as: source: assistant, destruction: true
If the header is ever not source: assistant, destination: user then mark it as a deviation and add that in your reasoning.

Prompts should be in English (no code) -

Task for raters:

Analyze the completed conversations of writers.

Adjust the response values of fields that you disagree with for each turn. Note that you will not be able to change the selected model response.

You can update any field the attempter filled out, including the response ranking, the dimension chosen, and the provided justification!
You cannot change the model response. For example, if rated a 2, you cannot change it to a 6 or 7. You should just change it so not marked as a deviation.  
Leave feedback for the writers so that they can improve their abilities to spot deviations!
If you see a Malformed Header (one that is not source: assistant, destination: user), mark it in the Malformed Header question.
